Welcome to my thesis final project!

In this project I trained a NLP model with Deep Learning algorithms , and connected to WhatsApp bot with Twilio API.
The bot receives messages from the user and sends them to the model.
The model processes the messages and classifies them as : suicidal/non suicidal , and replies to the user based on the resolution.

If the message is classified as "Suicidal" , a log will be sent to determined label in gmailbox via GCP.

The project is meant to be a POC for usage of ML and AI agent to help decrease suicide rate in an efficient way.

***GloVe file is required in the project, I did not upload it because it is a very large file.
